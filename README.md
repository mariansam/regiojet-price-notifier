# regiojet-price-notifier

Checks the price and available seats on a RegioJet route and outputs info when a big change has happened.

Meant to be run periodically using cron, which automatically emails you the output. (That's why no output on no change)

Built with [Deno](https://deno.land/).

Train-only probably. Not well tested.
